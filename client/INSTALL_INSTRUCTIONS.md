# Installation Instructions

## To fix the jsPDF import error:

1. **Navigate to the client directory:**
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Restart the dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The jsPDF package is already listed in `package.json`, so running `npm install` will install it.

## If you still see import errors:

Make sure you're running the latest version. The import syntax `import jsPDF from 'jspdf'` is correct for jsPDF v2.x.
