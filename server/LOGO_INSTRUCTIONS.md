# Logo Instructions

To add your company logo to the PDF certificate:

1. Find your company logo file (PNG, JPG, or JPEG format recommended)
2. Copy the logo file to the `server` directory
3. Rename it to `logo.png` (if it's a different format, convert it to PNG first)

The logo will automatically appear at the top center of the PDF certificate.

**Note:** If no logo is found, the certificate will be generated without a logo.
